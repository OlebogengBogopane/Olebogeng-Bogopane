 I have dedicated myself to acquiring a solid foundation in Software Development. I have a strong understanding of fundamental concepts such as  data structures, Arrays, and Loops. Additionally, I have gained practical experience coding with microbit, which have sharpened my ability to analyze, design, and implement software solutions.


I am familiar with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which  enable me to adapt and learn new technologies quickly.
