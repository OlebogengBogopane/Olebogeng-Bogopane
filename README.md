I am a student at Bafokeng CodeLab with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving, I am eager to embark on a professional journey where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow as a software developer.

 I have dedicated myself to acquiring a solid foundation in Software Development. I have a strong understanding of fundamental concepts such as  data structures, Arrays, and Loops. Additionally, I have gained practical experience coding with microbit, which have sharpened my ability to analyze, design, and implement software solutions.


I am familiar with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which  enable me to adapt and learn new technologies quickly.

What sets me apart is my strong communication and collaboration skills. I am an avid believer in effective teamwork and actively seek opportunities to contribute to a positive and productive work environment. I thrive in collaborative settings where ideas are shared, and I am always eager to learn from my peers and mentors.


As a junior software developer, I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, while also continuing to learn and grow alongside experienced professionals. I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and always strive for excellence in my work.
